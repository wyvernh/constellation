* What are these?

This is a collection of simple utilities for my operating systems, mostly in the form of scripts.
All that are useful on a Guix system will be packaged in mhguix, and some rely on other packages (mhdisk is a dependency of guix-installer).

These utilities are tangled from Org files:

- [[file:guix-installer.org][Guix Installer]]
- [[file:mhdisk.org][MHDisk]]
- [[file:mhguix-scripts.org][MHGuix Scripts]]
